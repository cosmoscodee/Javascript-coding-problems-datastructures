### Learning Javascript !!

```주의! 코드에 지저분하게 주석이 많을 수 있습니다.```

<br/>

I am not a very good at solving algorithms, but what I do is try to understand what the problem is, then I try to replicate it on paper to find a pattern. Not the most efficient way. But is a start.

Here are the basic algorithms and data structures code.
I learn starting basic  algorithms and data structures and then increase my problem-solving skills. I will grow up!

- While learning the basics, practice your gained knowledge by solving simple exercises(lang: java, python)
